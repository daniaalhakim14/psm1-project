ðŸ“± MyManageApp â€“ Final Year Project 1 (PSM 1)
This project is part of my Final Year Project 1 (Projek Sarjana Muda 1) at Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM), under the Faculty of Information and Communication Technology.

MyManageApp is a mobile application designed to help users manage their personal finances more effectively. The app provides a centralized platform to track spending across multiple financial platforms, compare item prices across nearby physical stores, and assist users in identifying tax-exempt expenses for income tax filing. By combining AI-driven features and automation, the goal is to help users make better financial decisions, reduce financial stress, and promote long-term financial stability.
